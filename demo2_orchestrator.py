"""Demo 2: one Strands agent on Bedrock that calls every backend as a tool.

The Neuron builds (Inferentia2, Trainium) cannot drive an agent -- no tool calls,
a 128-token prompt bucket -- but any of them can answer a short question. Here the
agent gets one tool per configured backend, `ask_<name>(prompt)`, plus
`scoreboard()`, and is asked to put the same question to all of them.

Every number comes from code: each ask_* tool times its own request and reads the
backend's completion token count; scoreboard() sorts and formats the table. The
agent's job is to call the tools and quote the table, not to compute or rank.

    python3 demo2_orchestrator.py --question "Name the largest planet in one word."
